## Conditional Diffusion model

### Sample images
##### All of them are frogs üê∏(*it's one of the labels in the CIFAR10 dataset*), because why not :), although maybe a horse could have been a nice choice too.

### This time we have done things 4 ways, since we have CFG(Classifier free guidance) and EMA(Exponential Moving Average)

### üö´EMA üö´CFG

##### Note: In the CFG paper the authors mentioned heavy saturation when CFG levels were too high(i.e = 3), we are able to reproduce that same effect in the above picture. 

## Clearly the results with EMA are much better generally, however CFG helps with more stable looking images :)
